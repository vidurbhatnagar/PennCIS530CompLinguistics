To that end, Dr. Yang and the university are moving on to the next frontier in genetic science with the opening of a $10.6 million center at the Storrs campus to study regenerative biology. The dedication of the center -- the Advanced Technology Laboratory in the Bio Science Complex -- on Monday marked UConn's attempt to become a major player in the highly competitive field. But just as cloning touched off a debate on the moral implications of the science, regenerative biology relies heavily on another hot-button issue: stem cell technology. While the new center will focus its research on animal stem cells, Dr. Yang said that each member of its team of experts has a specific area of focus. This means that if the political environment allows, they can shift to studying human stem cells without missing a beat, he said. Dr. Yang said that he hoped eventually to take what they have learned about therapeutic cloning in animals and apply it to humans, along the way finding clues about how to treat such degenerative diseases as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.	0
